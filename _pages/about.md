Hi, I'm Tim! ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher in the field of **natural language processing** and **knowledge engineering**.

Since January 2025, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher with [Prof. Michael FÃ¤rber](https://faerber-lab.github.io), focusing on **evidence-based AI for science** and **AI-assisted scientific discovery**. During my PhD at the [Technical University of Munich](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/1n0vb1ew7e6u5/Tim-Schopf), I investigated NLP and knowledge graph approaches to enhance exploratory searches for scholarly literature. My current research interests include _scientific claim verification & correction of LLM-generated content_, _attributed scientific text generation_, _LLMs for scientific reasoning_, and _AI agents for scientific discovery_.
