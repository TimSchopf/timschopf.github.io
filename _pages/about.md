Hi, I'm Tim! 👋

I am a researcher in the field of **natural language processing** and **knowledge engineering**.

Since January 2025, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher with [Prof. Michael Färber](https://faerber-lab.github.io), focusing on **evidence-based AI for science** and **AI-assisted scientific discovery**. During my PhD at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/sebis/team/alumni/tim-schopf), I investigated NLP and knowledge graph approaches to enhance exploratory searches for scholarly literature. My current research interests include _LLM hallucinations_, _attributed text generation_, _LLMs for scientific reasoning_, and _AI agents for scientific discovery_.
