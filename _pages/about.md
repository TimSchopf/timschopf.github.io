Hi, I'm Tim! ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher in the field of **natural language processing** and **knowledge engineering**.

Since January 2025, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai) and [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en), focusing on **evidence-based AI for science** and **AI-assisted scientific discovery**. During my PhD at the [Technical University of Munich](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/1n0vb1ew7e6u5/Tim-Schopf), I investigated NLP and knowledge graph approaches to enhance exploratory searches for scholarly literature. My current research interests include _LLMs for scientific reasoning_, _AI agents for scientific discovery_, _attributed scientific text generation_, and _scientific claim verification of AI-generated content_.
