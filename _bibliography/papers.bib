    abstract = "Scientific literature searches are often exploratory, whereby users are not yet familiar with a particular field or concept but are interested in learning more about it. However, existing systems for scientific literature search are typically tailored to keyword-based lookup searches, limiting the possibilities for exploration. We propose NLP-KG, a feature-rich system designed to support the exploration of research literature in unfamiliar natural language processing (NLP) fields. In addition to a semantic search, NLP-KG allows users to easily find survey papers that provide a quick introduction to a field of interest. Further, a Fields of Study hierarchy graph enables users to familiarize themselves with a field and its related areas. Finally, a chat interface allows users to ask questions about unfamiliar concepts or specific articles in NLP and obtain answers grounded in knowledge retrieved from scientific publications. Our system provides users with comprehensive exploration possibilities, supporting them in investigating the relationships between different fields, understanding unfamiliar concepts in NLP, and finding relevant research literature.

Supervised keyphrase extraction approaches need large amounts of labeled training data and perform poorly outside the domain of the training data (Bennani-Smires et al., 2018). In this paper, we present PatternRank, which leverages pretrained language models and part-of-speech for unsupervised keyphrase extraction from single documents. Our experiments show PatternRank achieves higher precision, recall and F1 -scores than previous state-of-the-art approaches.

abstract = {Text classification of unseen classes is a challenging Natural Language Processing task and is mainly attempted using two different types of approaches. Similarity-based approaches attempt to classify instances based on similarities between text document representations and class description representations. Zero-shot text classification approaches aim to generalize knowledge gained from a training task by assigning appropriate labels of unknown classes to text documents. Although existing studies have already investigated individual approaches to these categories, the experiments in literature do not provide a consistent comparison. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic evaluation of different similarity-based and zero-shot approaches for text classification of unseen classes. Different state-of-the-art approaches are benchmarked on four text classification datasets, including a new dataset from the medical domain. Additionally, novel SimCSE [7] and SBERT-based [26] baselines are proposed, as other baselines used in existing work yield weak classification results and are easily outperformed. Finally, the novel similarity-based Lbl2TransformerVec approach is presented, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised text classification. Our experiments show that similarity-based approaches significantly outperform zero-shot approaches in most cases. Additionally, using SimCSE or SBERT embeddings instead of simpler text representations increases similarity-based classification results even further.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the task of retrieving documents with predefined topics from an unlabeled document dataset using an unsupervised approach. The proposed unsupervised approach requires only a small number of keywords describing the respective topics and no labeled document. Existing approaches either heavily relied on a large amount of additionally encoded world knowledge or on term-document frequencies. Contrariwise, we introduce a method that learns jointly embedded document and word vectors solely from the unlabeled document dataset in order to find documents that are semantically similar to the topics described by the keywords. The proposed method requires almost no text preprocessing but is simultaneously effective at retrieving relevant documents with high probability. When successively retrieving documents on different predefined topics from publicly available and commonly used datasets, we achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve val ue of 0.95 on one dataset and 0.92 on another. Further, our method can be used for multiclass document classification, without the need to assign labels to the dataset in advance. Compared with an unsupervised classification baseline, we increased F1 scores from 76.6 to 82.7 and from 61.0 to 75.1 on the respective datasets. For easy replication of our approach, we make the developed Lbl2Vec code publicly available as a ready-to-use tool under the 3-Clause BSD license.},

However, collecting human-labeled data for many classes is expensive and usually leads to label-scarce scenarios. Moreover, recent work has shown that sentence embedding model fine-tuning for few-shot classification is efficient, robust, and effective. In this work, we propose FusionSent (Fusion-based Sentence Embedding Fine-tuning), an efficient and prompt-free approach for few-shot classification of scientific documents with many classes. FusionSent uses available training examples and their respective label texts to contrastively fine-tune two different sentence embedding models. Afterward, the parameters of both fine-tuned models are fused to combine the complementary knowledge from the separate fine-tuning steps into a single model. Finally, the resulting sentence embedding model is frozen to embed the training instances, which are then used as input features to train a classification head. Our experiments show that FusionSent significantly outperforms strong baselines by an average of 6.0 F1 points across multiple scientific document classification datasets. In addition, we introduce a new dataset for multi-label classification of scientific documents, which contains 203,961 scientific articles and 130 classes from the arXiv category taxonomy.",

    abstract = "Sentence embeddings enable us to capture the semantic similarity of short texts. Most sentence embedding models are trained for general semantic textual similarity tasks. Therefore, to use sentence embeddings in a particular domain, the model must be adapted to it in order to achieve good results. Usually, this is done by fine-tuning the entire sentence embedding model for the domain of interest. While this approach yields state-of-the-art results, all of the model`s weights are updated during fine-tuning, making this method resource-intensive. Therefore, instead of fine-tuning entire sentence embedding models for each target domain individually, we propose to train lightweight adapters. These domain-specific adapters do not require fine-tuning all underlying sentence embedding model parameters. Instead, we only train a small number of additional parameters while keeping the weights of the underlying sentence embedding model fixed. Training domain-specific adapters allows always using the same base model and only exchanging the domain-specific adapters to adapt sentence embeddings to a specific domain. We show that using adapters for parameter-efficient domain adaptation of sentence embeddings yields competitive performance within 1% of a domain-adapted, entirely fine-tuned sentence embedding model while only training approximately 3.6% of the parameters.",

Results indicate that AspectCSE achieves an average improvement of 3.97{\%} on information retrieval tasks across multiple aspects compared to the previous best results.

Because of this capability, word embeddings could be used in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. While domain-specific monolingual word embeddings are common in literature, domain-specific bilingual word embeddings are uncommon. In general, large text corpora are required for training high quality word embeddings. Furthermore, training domain-specific word embeddings necessitates the use of source texts from the relevant domain. To train bilingual domain-specific word embeddings, the domain-specific texts must also be available in two different languages. In this paper, we use a large dataset of engineering-related articles in German and English to train bilingual engineering-specific word embedding models using different approaches. We will evaluate our trained models, identify the most promising approach, and demonstrate that the best performing one is very capable of representing semantic relationships between engineering-specific words and mapping languages in a shared vector space. Moreover, we show that the additional use of an engineering-specific learning dictionary can improve the quality of bilingual engineering-specific word embeddings.},

The vector representations they provide are learned on huge corpora of unlabeled text data. Due to the large amount of data and computing power that is necessary to train such embedding models, very often, pre-trained models are applied which have been trained on domain unspecific data like newspaper articles or Wikipedia entries. In this paper, we present a domain-specific embedding model that is trained exclusively on texts from the domain of engineering. We will show that such a domain-specific embeddings model performs better in different NLP tasks and can therefore help to improve NLP-based AI in the domain of Engineering.},

    abstract = "Modern generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating text that sounds coherent and convincing, but are also prone to producing \textit{hallucinations}, facts that contradict the world knowledge. Even in the case of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where relevant context is first retrieved and passed in the input, the generated facts can contradict or not be verifiable by the provided references. This has motivated SciHal 2025, a shared task that focuses on the detection of hallucinations for scientific content. The two subtasks focused on: (1) predicting whether a claim from a generated LLM answer is entailed, contradicted, or unverifiable by the used references; (2) predicting a fine-grained category of erroneous claims. Our best performing approach used an ensemble of fine-tuned encoder-only ModernBERT and DeBERTa-v3 models for classification. Out of nine competing teams, our approach achieved the first place in sub-task 1 and the second place in sub-task 2.",

    abstract = "Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings.In this paper, we present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction.In contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language model.This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference time.Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$ Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation triples.Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a zero-shot setting.The code and synthetic dataset are made available for future research.",
