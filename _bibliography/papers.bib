    abstract = "Scientific literature searches are often exploratory, whereby users are not yet familiar with a particular field or concept but are interested in learning more about it. However, existing systems for scientific literature search are typically tailored to keyword-based lookup searches, limiting the possibilities for exploration. We propose NLP-KG, a feature-rich system designed to support the exploration of research literature in unfamiliar natural language processing (NLP) fields. In addition to a semantic search, NLP-KG allows users to easily find survey papers that provide a quick introduction to a field of interest. Further, a Fields of Study hierarchy graph enables users to familiarize themselves with a field and its related areas. Finally, a chat interface allows users to ask questions about unfamiliar concepts or specific articles in NLP and obtain answers grounded in knowledge retrieved from scientific publications. Our system provides users with comprehensive exploration possibilities, supporting them in investigating the relationships between different fields, understanding unfamiliar concepts in NLP, and finding relevant research literature. Demo, video, and code are available at: https://github.com/NLP-Knowledge-Graph/NLP-KG-WebApp."

abstract = {Text classification of unseen classes is a challenging Natural Language Processing task and is mainly attempted using two different types of approaches. Similarity-based approaches attempt to classify instances based on similarities between text document representations and class description representations. Zero-shot text classification approaches aim to generalize knowledge gained from a training task by assigning appropriate labels of unknown classes to text documents. Although existing studies have already investigated individual approaches to these categories, the experiments in literature do not provide a consistent comparison. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic evaluation of different similarity-based and zero-shot approaches for text classification of unseen classes. Different state-of-the-art approaches are benchmarked on four text classification datasets, including a new dataset from the medical domain. Additionally, novel SimCSE [7] and SBERT-based [26] baselines are proposed, as other baselines used in existing work yield weak classification results and are easily outperformed. Finally, the novel similarity-based Lbl2TransformerVec approach is presented, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised text classification. Our experiments show that similarity-based approaches significantly outperform zero-shot approaches in most cases. Additionally, using SimCSE or SBERT embeddings instead of simpler text representations increases similarity-based classification results even further.},

abstract="In this paper, we evaluate the Lbl2Vec approach for unsupervised text document classification. Lbl2Vec requires only a small number of keywords describing the respective classes to create semantic label representations. For classification, Lbl2Vec uses cosine similarities between label and document representations, but no annotation information. We show that Lbl2Vec significantly outperforms common unsupervised text classification approaches and a widely used zero-shot text classification approach. Furthermore, we show that using more precise keywords can significantly improve the classification results of similarity-based text classification approaches.",

    abstract = "Sentence embeddings enable us to capture the semantic similarity of short texts. Most sentence embedding models are trained for general semantic textual similarity tasks. Therefore, to use sentence embeddings in a particular domain, the model must be adapted to it in order to achieve good results. Usually, this is done by fine-tuning the entire sentence embedding model for the domain of interest. While this approach yields state-of-the-art results, all of the model`s weights are updated during fine-tuning, making this method resource-intensive. Therefore, instead of fine-tuning entire sentence embedding models for each target domain individually, we propose to train lightweight adapters. These domain-specific adapters do not require fine-tuning all underlying sentence embedding model parameters. Instead, we only train a small number of additional parameters while keeping the weights of the underlying sentence embedding model fixed. Training domain-specific adapters allows always using the same base model and only exchanging the domain-specific adapters to adapt sentence embeddings to a specific domain. We show that using adapters for parameter-efficient domain adaptation of sentence embeddings yields competitive performance within 1{\%} of a domain-adapted, entirely fine-tuned sentence embedding model while only training approximately 3.6{\%} of the parameters."

Conversely, aspect-based sentence embeddings provide similarities between texts based on certain predefined aspects. Thus, similarity predictions of texts are more targeted to specific requirements and more easily explainable. In this paper, we present AspectCSE, an approach for aspect-based contrastive learning of sentence embeddings. Results indicate that AspectCSE achieves an average improvement of 3.97{\%} on information retrieval tasks across multiple aspects compared to the previous best results. We also propose the use of Wikidata knowledge graph properties to train models of multi-aspect sentence embeddings in which multiple specific aspects are simultaneously considered during similarity predictions. We demonstrate that multi-aspect embeddings outperform even single-aspect embeddings on aspect-specific information retrieval tasks. Finally, we examine the aspect-based sentence embedding space and demonstrate that embeddings of semantically similar aspect labels are often close, even without explicit similarity training between different aspect labels."

abstract = {Word embeddings represent the semantic meanings of words in high-dimensional vector space. Because of this capability, word embeddings could be used in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. While domain-specific monolingual word embeddings are common in literature, domain-specific bilingual word embeddings are uncommon. In general, large text corpora are required for training high quality word embeddings. Furthermore, training domain-specific word embeddings necessitates the use of source texts from the relevant domain. To train bilingual domain-specific word embeddings, the domain-specific texts must also be available in two different languages. In this paper, we use a large dataset of engineering-related articles in German and English to train bilingual engineering-specific word embedding models using different approaches. We will evaluate our trained models, identify the most promising approach, and demonstrate that the best performing one is very capable of representing semantic relationships between engineering-specific words and mapping languages in a shared vector space. Moreover, we show that the additional use of an engineering-specific learning dictionary can improve the quality of bilingual engineering-specific word embeddings.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of Word2Vec in 2013, so-called word embeddings, dense vector representation of words that are supposed to capture their semantic meaning, have become a universally applied technique in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and domains. The vector representations they provide are learned on huge corpora of unlabeled text data. Due to the large amount of data and computing power that is necessary to train such embedding models, very often, pre-trained models are applied which have been trained on domain unspecific data like newspaper articles or Wikipedia entries. In this paper, we present a domain-specific embedding model that is trained exclusively on texts from the domain of engineering. We will show that such a domain-specific embeddings model performs better in different NLP tasks and can therefore help to improve NLP-based AI in the domain of Engineering.},
